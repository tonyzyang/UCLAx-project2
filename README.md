the domain of the problem <br />
1 **describe the real-world source of the dataset** <br />
The Adult Mechine learning data set from the UCI data base is to predict the future income is over 50k or not <br />
**some kind of literature review is always a plus i.e. answer the question, "How has data science or machine learning been used to solve this or similar problems in the past?"**<br />
it used the training set and test set method to train the data 

**a problem statement in which you clearly define<br />
the inputs** : age, workclass, fnlwgt, educatoin, 
                    educatoin_num', marital_status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, 
                     capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_per_week, native_country, income <br />
**the type of data science or machine learning you intend to do** <br />
because the data was not numerical, so use the logistic model <br />

**the outputs** <br />



**a description of the dataset including:<br />
the size of the dataset both in terms of rows and columns, but also in memory**<br />
32560rows 15columns, 


**the types of the data** 
non-numorical data

**summary statistics of the data**








distribution of the target class (if applicable) and a few key features
required: your final submission should have a notebook to accompany this section (see below)
a proposed solution 
propose a kind of model that you believe might solve this problem
a benchmark model
a naive model against which you will be able to compare your work
a performance metric 
used to assess the performance of your proposed solution
