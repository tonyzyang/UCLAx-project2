the domain of the problem <br />
1 **describe the real-world source of the dataset** <br />
The Adult Mechine learning data set from the UCI data base is to predict the future income is over 50k or not <br />

**some kind of literature review is always a plus i.e. answer the question, "How has data science or machine learning been used to solve this or similar problems in the past?"**<br />
it used the training set and test set method to train the data 

**a problem statement in which you clearly define<br />
the inputs** : age, workclass, fnlwgt, educatoin, 
                    educatoin_num', marital_status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, 
                     capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_per_week, native_country <br />
                     
                     
**the type of data science or machine learning you intend to do** <br />
because the data was not numerical, so use the logistic model <br />

**the outputs** <br />
income prediction


**a description of the dataset including:<br />
the size of the dataset both in terms of rows and columns, but also in memory**<br />
32560rows 15columns, 1572720 bytes<br />


**the types of the data** <br />
non-numorical data, character vector <br />

**summary statistics of the data** <br />
